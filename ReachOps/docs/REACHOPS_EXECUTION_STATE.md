# ReachOps Execution State

- Schema: `reachops.execution_state.v1`
- Contract: `REACHOPS_MASTER_EXECUTION_CONTRACT_V1.md`
- Last manually reconciled: `2026-07-17`
- Rule: verify every status against the repository before acting.

## Current project state

ReachOps is an independent Windows 10/11 local client project. Product direction is locked. The project is in engineering convergence, not final customer delivery.

## Milestone status

| Priority | Milestone | Status | Verified evidence | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Truthful execution semantics | `IN_REVIEW` | Draft PR #10, branch `agent/reachops-truthful-execution-p0`; new truthfulness tests reported 5/5 passed; not merged into `main` | Review and merge without new regressions; preserve no-live-action boundary |
| P1 | Immutable Campaign Run / Observation model | `READY` | Architecture audit identified campaign/batch attribution overwrite risk | Idempotent migrations; run-scoped observations; historical decisions immutable; tests pass |
| P2 | Windows local security, licensing, backup, device seats | `PLANNED` | Product contract locked | Windows Credential Manager, minimal license client, 7-day grace, encrypted backup/restore, tests |
| P3 | Public comment-reply monitoring and lead lifecycle | `PLANNED` | Product contract locked | Automatic public reply detection; action linkage; qualified-lead state; manual conversion/revenue capture |
| P4 | Bilingual UI, installer, update, Windows acceptance | `PLANNED` | Existing packaging/runbook exists but final external acceptance is incomplete | Win10/11 installer, zh-CN/en-US UI, update flow, acceptance matrix, authorized live evidence |
| P5 | DM inbox monitoring | `DEFERRED` | Explicitly deferred behind public reply monitoring | Separate privacy/evidence contract and acceptance after P3/P4 |

## Next autonomous action

1. Reconcile PR #10 against current `main` and its checks.
2. If P0 is review-ready, do not expand it with P1. Prepare a concise merge/readiness report.
3. Start P1 on a separate branch/PR:
   - add `campaign_runs`
   - add `source_observations`
   - add `content_observations`
   - add `comment_observations`
   - add `candidate_observations`
   - add versioned `lead_decisions`
   - keep existing global entities for compatibility
   - scope scoring and lead creation to run/batch observations
   - add idempotent migration and rollback evidence
   - add cross-campaign isolation tests

## Known external blockers

- Authorized Windows + ixBrowser + logged-in TikTok environment is required for final platform validation.
- Real targets and activation inputs must remain local and git-ignored.
- Windows code-signing certificate is not currently available; internal builds may show an unknown-publisher warning.
- Natural user replies cannot be guaranteed; authorized test accounts may validate reply-linking mechanics, while natural reply rate remains a business observation.

## Non-blocking engineering work available

- P1 observation model and migration.
- LeadDecision versioning and unified scoring contract.
- Follow/DM evidence validators in no-submit fixtures.
- Windows Credential Manager abstraction and unit tests.
- Encrypted backup format and restore tests.
- License state machine and 7-day grace logic.
- Localization resource extraction for `zh-CN` and `en-US`.
- Public reply-monitor parser using redacted/replay fixtures.

## State-update rules

Codex must update this file at the end of each milestone with:

- status transition
- commit and PR
- tests executed and exact result
- evidence paths
- blockers
- next autonomous action

Do not write `COMPLETE` unless every exit condition is supported by evidence. Implementation completion and external live acceptance are separate states.
