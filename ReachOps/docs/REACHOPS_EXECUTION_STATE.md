# ReachOps Execution State

- Schema: `reachops.execution_state.v1`
- Contract: `REACHOPS_MASTER_EXECUTION_CONTRACT_V1.md`
- Last manually reconciled: `2026-07-17`
- Rule: verify every status against the repository before acting.

## Current project state

ReachOps is an independent Windows 10/11 local client project. Product direction is locked. The project is in engineering convergence, not final customer delivery.

## Milestone status

| Priority | Milestone | Status | Verified evidence | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Truthful execution semantics | `IN_REVIEW` | Draft PR #10, branch `agent/reachops-truthful-execution-p0`; rebased on `origin/main`; evidence verification blocker fixed so live mode alone cannot set `evidence_verified`; `tests.test_truthful_execution_semantics` 7/7 passed on 2026-07-17; campaign baseline remains 230 tests with 15 failures and 1 existing live-readiness error | Review and merge without new Evidence regressions; preserve no-live-action boundary; external Windows/TikTok acceptance remains separate |
| P1 | Immutable Campaign Run / Observation model | `READY` | Architecture audit identified campaign/batch attribution overwrite risk | Idempotent migrations; run-scoped observations; historical decisions immutable; tests pass |
| P2 | Windows local security, licensing, backup, device seats | `PLANNED` | Product contract locked | Windows Credential Manager, minimal license client, 7-day grace, encrypted backup/restore, tests |
| P3 | Public comment-reply monitoring and lead lifecycle | `PLANNED` | Product contract locked | Automatic public reply detection; action linkage; qualified-lead state; manual conversion/revenue capture |
| P4 | Bilingual UI, installer, update, Windows acceptance | `PLANNED` | Existing packaging/runbook exists but final external acceptance is incomplete | Win10/11 installer, zh-CN/en-US UI, update flow, acceptance matrix, authorized live evidence |
| P5 | DM inbox monitoring | `DEFERRED` | Explicitly deferred behind public reply monitoring | Separate privacy/evidence contract and acceptance after P3/P4 |

## Next autonomous action

1. Review PR #10 evidence-truthfulness correction and merge only after accepting the known non-P0 baseline failures separately.
2. Do not expand PR #10 with P1.
3. After P0 merges, start P1 on a separate branch/PR:
   - add `campaign_runs`
   - add `source_observations`
   - add `content_observations`
   - add `comment_observations`
   - add `candidate_observations`
   - add versioned `lead_decisions`
   - keep existing global entities for compatibility
   - scope scoring and lead creation to run/batch observations
   - add idempotent migration and rollback evidence
   - add cross-campaign isolation tests

## Known external blockers

- Authorized Windows + ixBrowser + logged-in TikTok environment is required for final platform validation.
- Real targets and activation inputs must remain local and git-ignored.
- Windows code-signing certificate is not currently available; internal builds may show an unknown-publisher warning.
- Natural user replies cannot be guaranteed; authorized test accounts may validate reply-linking mechanics, while natural reply rate remains a business observation.

## Latest P0 verification snapshot

- Date: `2026-07-17`
- Branch: `agent/reachops-truthful-execution-p0`
- Scope: PR #10 P0 Evidence truthfulness blocker only.
- Code evidence:
  - Live success calls `_valid_execution_evidence(...)` before setting `evidence_verified`.
  - URI evidence, including generated `evidence://...` stubs, cannot verify live success.
  - Missing/invalid mandatory live evidence remains `LIVE_SUBMIT_EVIDENCE_MISSING`.
  - Optional invalid live evidence records `submission_state=submitted_unverified`, `verification_state=pending`, `evidence_verified=0`, increments `live_submitted`, does not increment `live_verified`, and keeps actions/leads out of completed/contacted.
- Tests and checks:
  - `python` command unavailable in this shell: exit `127`, `zsh:1: command not found: python`.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 -m py_compile ReachOps/workbench/action_router.py tests/test_truthful_execution_semantics.py tests/test_reachops_campaign.py tools/reachops_delivery_audit.py tools/reachops_live_submit_acceptance.py`: passed.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 -m unittest -v tests.test_truthful_execution_semantics`: passed, 7 tests.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 -m unittest -v tests.test_reachops_campaign`: failed with 15 failures and 1 error; live evidence URI/stub regressions are covered and no longer error, remaining failures are existing non-P0 baseline/live-readiness/profile/UI/final-delivery blockers.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 tools/reachops_operator_pressure.py --json`: passed, `status=ok`.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 tools/reachops_delivery_audit.py --json`: failed, `status=failed`, summary `passed=46`, `pending_external_validation=3`, `failed=5`; Evidence guard check passed, failures are non-P0 delivery/UI/funnel baseline checks.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 tools/reachops_goal_delivery_runner.py --json`: failed, `status=not_ready`; blockers include local MVP evidence, Windows final artifacts, external authorized execution, and delivery audit.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 tools/reachops_goal_status_report.py --json`: failed, `status=failed`; blockers include delivery audit, client delivery gate, Windows package, and external validation.
  - `/usr/bin/python3 tools/reachops_repository_cleanliness_check.py --json`: passed, `forbidden_count=0`.
  - `git diff --check`: passed.
- Safety:
  - No real TikTok action was executed.
  - Fixture live execution remains blocked by default and is only enabled in explicit test fixture paths through `REACHOPS_ALLOW_TEST_FIXTURE_LIVE=1`.

## Non-blocking engineering work available

- P1 observation model and migration.
- LeadDecision versioning and unified scoring contract.
- Follow/DM evidence validators in no-submit fixtures.
- Windows Credential Manager abstraction and unit tests.
- Encrypted backup format and restore tests.
- License state machine and 7-day grace logic.
- Localization resource extraction for `zh-CN` and `en-US`.
- Public reply-monitor parser using redacted/replay fixtures.

## State-update rules

Codex must update this file at the end of each milestone with:

- status transition
- commit and PR
- tests executed and exact result
- evidence paths
- blockers
- next autonomous action

Do not write `COMPLETE` unless every exit condition is supported by evidence. Implementation completion and external live acceptance are separate states.
